# build-keys [![Build status for build-keys on Circle CI.](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/sholladay/build-keys/master.svg "Circle Build Status")](https://circleci.com/gh/sholladay/build-keys "Build Keys Builds")

> Get the paths of files from your build.

## Why?

 - Useful for copying build artifacts.
 - Agnostic of how the files were written.
 - Excludes directories, perfect for Amazon S3.

## Install

```sh
npm install build-keys --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const buildKeys = require('build-keys');
```

Get a list of the filepaths that exist within the most recent build, excluding directories.

```js
buildKeys.latest().then((keys) => {
    console.log('keys:', keys);
    // [
    //     'master/1.0.0/foo.js',
    //     'master/latest/foo.js'
    // ]
});
```
